<p> Hi! My name is Zachary Howard. I am a ninth grader at Pace Academy in Atlanta, Georgia. I was born on May 2, 2002 and I am 14 (almost 15) years old. I play many sports including Baseball, Basketball, and my parents made me run Cross Country. This is the Digital Portfolio I created for my Intro To Programming Class. </p>
